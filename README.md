Sources for a few different elements of my video productions

# Manim Videos

These require installation of [ManimCE](https://www.manim.community/) and also adding `manim_drawn` to the python path (Although I just add it in the individual python files atm).
Install the packages in `requirements.txt`
Then you can `cd` into the particular folders relating to a video project and run

```bash
    py -m manim -pql <filename> <class_name>
```

To play an animation.
